(1)With the new catkin_tools, there are few changed from the Catkin-y method described above. To generate eclipse-project you need to execute:

	catkin build  --force-cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" 

(2)to generate the .project files for each package and then run: the follwoing script
  (((Yo lo guardÃ© en catkin_ws como eclipse_ros_script))

	ROOT=$PWD 
	cd build
	for PROJECT in `find $PWD -name .project`; do
	    DIR=`dirname $PROJECT`
	    echo $DIR
	    cd $DIR
	    awk -f $(rospack find mk)/eclipse.awk .project > .project_with_env && mv .project_with_env .project
	done
	cd $ROOT
	
(3)After executing this command you will find the project files in the build/ folder. 
Now you can import your project as existing project into workspace.

(4)To debug use the following command and you can mention the name of the package to configure that specific
project for debug instead of the entire workspace. Remember 
to run the script to modify .project to pass the current shell environment into the make process in Eclipse.

	catkin build  --force-cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
